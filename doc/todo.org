* Windows
** DONE NamedScratchPad: Add one for my password manager
   CLOSED: [2017-02-22 Wed 13:09]
** DONE Fix stupid file dialogs that set their size to being very skinny
   CLOSED: [2014-11-13 Thu 15:26]
** DONE Update pointer on keyboard focus change
   CLOSED: [2013-07-29 Mon 12:27]
   - Key bindings that change the window focus should also call into
     the update pointer package to update the current pointer
     location.
** DONE Automatically float dialogs
   CLOSED: [2013-04-20 Sat 18:06]
   - This probably already works but my handbreak manage hook prevents
     dialogs opened by handbreak to float properly.
