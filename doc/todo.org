* Windows
** TODO Update pointer on keyboard focus change
   - Key bindings that change the window focus should also call into
     the update pointer package to update the current pointer
     location.
** DONE Automatically float dialogs
   CLOSED: [2013-04-20 Sat 18:06]
   - This probably already works but my handbreak manage hook prevents
     dialogs opened by handbreak to float properly.
